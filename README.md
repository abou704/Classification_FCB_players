# Classification_FCB_players

I am happy to share with you my first Deep Learning project in python with Tensorflow-keras.
The goal of this project is to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will serve to classify photos of the three football players (Iniesta, Neymar and Messi).

To achieve this goal, I train the fine-tuned VGG16 model to classify images of the three football players.
Finally, I use a simple Flask App to build a web application in order to visualize the result of the model.
In this video, you can see that the model predicts well the images given in input with a pretty good accuracy.
The next step is to build more deeply learning apps using NLP, RNN models and so on..

PS: Sorry for Real Madrid supporters üòÅ
